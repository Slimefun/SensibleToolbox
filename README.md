Sensible Toolbox is a Spigot/Paper plugin which adds a bunch of new items, tools and machines to your Minecraft Server.
It's heavily inspired by certain Forge-based mods, but of course requires no client modifications at all.

Also check out [Slimefun4](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4), they pair really well together!

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: About the project
SensibleToolbox was created in early 2014 and originally developed by [desht](https://github.com/desht), here is a link to the original GitHub Repository: https://github.com/desht/sensibletoolbox.<br>
I took over the project back in late 2014 and continued to update it for some time until I have quit plugin development altogether in late 2016.<br>
In late 2020 STB was finally updated once more but it is currently very unstable, so please report any bugs you can find!

## :floppy_disk: Download Sensible Toolbox
You can download SensibleToolbox for free right here: [Development Builds](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/Slimefun/SensibleToolbox/master/)<br>

**WARNING: STB has only just been updated to newer versions of Minecraft, builds are extremely unstable and we don't recommend you to use them on any live server.**

## :bulb: Credits
This is a fork of [desht/sensibletoolbox](https://github.com/desht/sensibletoolbox).

Sensible Toolbox is primarily original code, but many of its ideas stem from popular Forge mods.
So credit where credit is due:
* The BSU/HSU blocks are based on Barrels from Factorization and Jabba, also the Deep Storage Unit from Minefactory Reloaded.
* The processing machines get their inspiration from multiple Forge-based mods, in particular IC2 and Thermal Expansion.
* The energy system is primarily inspired by Thermal Expansion.
* Numerous miscellaneous items are adapted (sometimes blatantly!) from Misc Utilities and OpenBlocks.
* The item routing system is entirely original (as far as I'm aware), mainly due to the fact that it's difficult to do pipes with vanilla Minecraft blocks :)
* The ender storage system is inspired by and works similarly (but not identically) to Ender Storage.
