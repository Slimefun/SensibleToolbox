            * [ ] We were unable to reproduce issue, if you think your issue still persists then please comment down below and give a better description on how to reproduce it.
            * [ ] Your issue was posted in a foreign language, we only accept english issues on here.
            * [ ] Your issue is not a bug, it is intended to work this way.
            * [ ] Your issue is not really a bug, it is a limitation or simply something we have no control over.
            * [ ] Your issue is not a bug, please only use this issue tracker to report bugs. Any other kind of communication should happen on discord.
            * [ ] Your issue has already been reported before, it is a duplicate. Check the other issues first before posting!
            * [ ] You posted an error without using pastebin. Please always post errors via pastebin otherwise they become nearly unreadable.
            * [ ] You seem to be reporting multiple bugs at once. Please make a separate issue for each bug you encountered, so we can properly handle them individually.
            * [ ] Your issue has already been fixed in a later version of SensibleToolbox, you should update.
            * [ ] You are using an outdated and unsupported version of SensibleToolbox, again, you should update.
            * [ ] You are using an unofficially modified build of SensibleToolbox. We only support official versions of SensibleToolbox - for obvious reasons.
            * [ ] You are using an unsupported version of Minecraft. We only provide support for the Minecraft versions SensibleToolbox was developed for, older versions are not supported anymore.
            * [ ] You are on the wrong issue tracker. We would like to remind you that this Issue Tracker is **only for SensibleToolbox**.
